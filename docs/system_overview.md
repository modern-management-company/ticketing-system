# Modern Management Ticketing System - System Overview

## Architecture Overview

The Modern Management Ticketing System is a full-stack web application built with a React frontend and Flask backend. The system is designed to help property managers track and resolve maintenance issues, service requests, and other tasks across multiple properties.

### Key Components

1. **Frontend**: React-based single-page application with Material UI components
2. **Backend**: Flask RESTful API with JWT authentication
3. **Database**: SQLAlchemy ORM with relational database support
4. **Authentication**: JWT-based token authentication with role-based access control
5. **Notifications**: Email and SMS notification systems for alerts and updates

## System Structure

### Consoles and Access Levels

The system provides different interfaces based on user roles:

1. **Main Application**: Available to all authenticated users
   - Dashboard
   - Tickets
   - Tasks
   - Rooms
   - Service Requests
   - Reports (for managers and above)

2. **Management Console**: Available to managers, general managers, and super admins
   - Property Management
   - User Management (general managers and super admins only)

3. **System Console**: Available to super admins only
   - System Settings
   - History/Audit Logs
   - Email Configuration
   - SMS Configuration
   - Attachment Settings

### Role Hierarchy

The system implements a hierarchical role system:

1. **Super Admin**: Full system access, including system console
2. **General Manager**: Manages multiple properties and their associated managers and users
3. **Manager**: Manages a single property and its users
4. **User**: Basic access to create and view tickets

## Database Schema

The system uses a relational database with the following core entities:

1. **Users**: Account information, authentication, and role assignments
2. **Properties**: Buildings or locations being managed
3. **Rooms**: Individual units within properties
4. **Tickets**: Issues reported by users
5. **Tasks**: Work assignments created from tickets
6. **Service Requests**: Specific service needs for rooms

## API Structure

The backend provides a RESTful API with the following key endpoints:

1. **Authentication**: `/login`, `/register`, `/verify-token`
2. **Users**: User management, role assignment, property assignments
3. **Properties**: Property CRUD, room management
4. **Tickets**: Issue tracking and resolution
5. **Tasks**: Task assignment and management
6. **Reports**: Performance metrics and statistics
7. **Settings**: System configuration options

## Security Model

The system implements several security mechanisms:

1. **Authentication**: JWT tokens with expiration
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control
3. **Data Validation**: Input validation at API endpoints
4. **Password Security**: Hashed passwords with salts
5. **Audit Trails**: History tracking for all significant actions

## Integration Points

The system can integrate with:

1. **Email Providers**: For sending notifications
2. **SMS Providers**: For text message alerts
3. **File Storage Systems**: Local or cloud storage for attachments

## Deployment Architecture

The system can be deployed in various configurations:

1. **Development**: Local deployment for testing and development
2. **Production**: Scalable cloud deployment with load balancing
3. **Multi-tenant**: Support for multiple organizations with data separation
